# The Grand Battle 🕹️

**The Grand Battle** is a 2D side-scrolling battle game developed using **Python** and **Pygame**. You control a hero who must fight an enemy (goblin) using projectiles. The game features animated character sprites, background music, health bars, and a basic scoring/life system.

---

## 🎮 How to Play

- Use the **LEFT** and **RIGHT** arrow keys to move your character.
- Press **SPACE** to shoot green bullets at the enemy.
- The enemy (goblin) moves left and right and fires red bullets at you.
- Hitting the enemy increases your score.
- Getting hit reduces your score and lives.
- If you lose all lives → **Game Over**
- If you defeat the enemy → **You Win!**
